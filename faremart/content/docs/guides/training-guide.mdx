## Training Information & Expectations
Faremart expects all participants to remain professional during trainings and follow established protocols. This guide is designed to ensure new employees thrive as they begin their journey with us.

### Training Guidelines
* Trainers should move at a steady pace so new employees have time to absorb the information.
* Use the :pm command instead of Roblox chat for communication.
* If a trainer disconnects or leaves, trainees must remain at their designated spot until the trainer returns. Another trainer may take over after **2** minutes if the original trainer does not rejoin.
* New employees are allowed one AFK per training session, lasting no longer than **2** minutes. They must notify their trainer before going AFK.
* Any disruptive or unprofessional behavior will result in consequences.
